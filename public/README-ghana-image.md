# Ghana Landscape Background Image

This file serves as a placeholder for the ghana-landscape.jpg image.

## Instructions to add the image:
1. Save the attached landscape image as `ghana-landscape.jpg` in the `/public` folder
2. The image will automatically be accessible at `/ghana-landscape.jpg` in your Next.js app
3. The component has been updated to use this local image path

## Alternative:
If you prefer to use a hosted image URL, you can upload the image to:
- Imgur
- ImageBB  
- Cloudinary
- Any other image hosting service

And then update the backgroundImage prop in page.tsx with the hosted URL.
